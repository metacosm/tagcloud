# Jahia Tag Cloud module experiment

This is a learning experiment for me to get a better grasp of the Jahia architecture and implementation. The goal is to
create a new tag cloud module that would be able to display the tag cloud associated with a Jahia component bound to the
tag cloud component this module will define. Moreover, it should be possible to filter out the bound component content
based on selected tag.
